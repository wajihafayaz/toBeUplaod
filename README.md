Before wajiha changes this line, I've changed it. So now wajiha's version of this file is different from what is now on the master branch on origin (remote repository). this will cause a conflict, so wajiha has to decide which version she wants to keep and commit it after making necessary changes.

this line #10 is somehow a change from my side ( addition)
